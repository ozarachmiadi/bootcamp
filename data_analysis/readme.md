# üåè A Localization Strategy: The Road to Optimize Amazon AWS SaaS Sales
Amazon is an American multinational technology company engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The Amazon SaaS (Software-as-a-service) is a cloud-based software model that delivers applications to end-users through the internet.
Based on the [Amazon AWS Saas Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnthanh101/aws-saas-sales), ***what would be the recommended strategy to optimize Amazon's sales based on existing trends?***

Project objectives:
1. Understand the trends across customer segments, regions, and products
2. Explore what factors may influence sales trends the most
3. Recommend strategies to optimize sales

The .ipynb file documents the process of analyzing Amazon's data, divided into three main sections:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Conclusion and Recommendation

*Note: Each section is an iterative process and goes back and forth as needed. For example, while analyzing and visualizing data, data errors may be found, which led us to revise the data cleaning section. The separation of these sections aims to organize and structure the process only.*
