Amazon is an American multinational technology company engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. The Amazon SaaS (Software-as-a-service) is a cloud-based software model that delivers applications to end-users through the internet.
Based on the [Amazon AWS Saas Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnthanh101/aws-saas-sales), ***what would be the recommended strategy to optimize Amazon's sales based on existing trends?***

Project objectives:
1. Understand the trends across customer segments, regions, and products
2. Explore what factors may influence sales trends the most
3. Recommend strategies to optimize sales

This file documents the process of analyzing Amazon's data, divided into three main sections:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Analysis and Visualization
3. Conclusion and Recommendation

*Note: Each section is an iterative process and goes back and forth as needed. For example, while analyzing and visualizing data, data errors may be found, which led us to revise the data cleaning section. The separation of these sections aim to organize and structure the process only.*

**Conclusion:**
1. The distribution of sales and profits significantly differ across product and region, with no significant differences across industries, segments, and customers.
2. Globally, increased discounts were associated with lower sales and quantity. However, very few countries present an opposite trend.
3. While there are products such as Alchemy, Big OI Database, and Support that has similar trends globally, the trend of other products remain scattered.

**Recommendations:**
1. Adopt a product bundling or cross-selling strategy where promotions are based on sales trends by order location
2. Reevaluate discount strategy, why is it not increasing sales? (e.g., branding, promotions, reputation)
3. Learn from top-performing locations and conduct A/B testing to localize the strategy in another location.
